    "**Short description**: Use the publicly released NYC 2016 Energy and Water Data Disclosure dataset to perform some basic exploratory analysis on NYC building energy consumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Long description ####\n",
    "\n",
    "  _Benchmarking_ is a process used to measure the energy performance of one facility or group of facilities with particular characteristics against another group of facilities or a specific standard. This study shows how to calculate Energy Use Intensity (EUI) for facilities and show how to do a comparative analysis of EUI amongst different types of buildings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this python project, we will perform an exploratory analysis of buildings from NYC 2016 Energy and Water Data Disclosure dataset in order to generate an EUI comparison of different groups of buildings. The project makes heavy use of `pandas` DataFrames for cleaning and generating grouped datasets as well as basic aggregation statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets used ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project is taken from the NYC Energy and Water Data Disclosure for 2016 found as an excel spreadsheet here: http://www.nyc.gov/html/gbee/html/plan/ll84_scores.shtml. \n",

    "`nyc_benchmarking_disclosure_data_reported_in_2016_subset`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsnacks000/nyc-benchmarking-dataset/master/data/nyc_benchmarking_disclosure_data_reported_in_2016_subset.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "I've cleaned and simplified this dataset somewhat from the original in order to remove extraneous metadata columns as well as filter out groups of buildings that are more complicated to analyze. Columns with extraneous property type info as well as water usage were also removed. However some fields of the dataset are left purposely messy so that students will have a chance to do some cleaning operations in pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The EUI columns have also been removed so that the student can use basic formulas and apply methods to calculate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of filters used:\n",
    "* Co-reported: None \n",
    "* Parent Property: N/A\n",
    "* DOF Benchmarking Compliance: In Compliance\n",
    "* occupancy: 100%\n",
    "* metered areas: Whole Building\n",
    "* number of buildings reported : 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumed student background ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The student should have some basic familiarity with python control strucutures and language basics. The student should be comfortable writing small helper functions in pure python using the `def` keyword, as well as inline functions using `lambda`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the core work will tied into `pandas`. The student should understand how to filter and subset data using `[]`notation and the `.loc` method. The student needs to also be familiar with `NaN` datatype and how to use the `.apply()` method to make changes to whole columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely on the `.groupby()` method to group and aggregate data amongst different building types and user-defined categories. Finally we will use inline `matplotlib` to construct basic plots to visualize these different aggregations and look for correlations between variables for further study.  \n"

    "### 1. The Hidden Nature of Buildings\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often easy to take the buildings we live and work in for granted as these sort of static structures that auto-magically supply us with what we need. Heat to get through brutal winter months, water to boil to make food (and coffee!), electricity to power all our smart devices... There are far too many to name! But how well does our building keep us warm? What kind of demand do all our devices place on the electrical grid? How can we make improvements in order for our buildings to run more efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building operations are indeed highly dynamic systems and studying building consumption gives energy data scientists the ability to attempt to answer some of these (and much more complicated) questions. In the field of Energy Data Analysis, one of the first steps an analyst can do is a process called _benchmarking_. Benchmarking allows us to compare energy performance from one facility to another, one facility to many other facilities, or as in the case of this study, one group of facilities against other groups of facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we explore this dataset we'll learn about the various types of fuel used to power buildings along with measurements that are used by Energy Analyists in order to gain insight into a building's performance. In particular we'll focus on calculating and comparing source and site Energy Use Intensity (EUI), which is a standard way of measuring a building's energy use in relation to its gross square footage. We'll also focus our attention on public buildings such as offices, hotels and hospitals to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by importing and cleaning a subset of the **NYC Benchmarking and Disclosure Data for 2016** using `pandas` and its awesome `.read_csv()` function. The dataset contains metadata and energy usage in kBtu for over 10000 facilities. \n"
